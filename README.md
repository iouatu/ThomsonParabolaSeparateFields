# ThomsonParabolaSeparateFields

What is different from the other repo for TS modelling, this one can create any number of E and/or B field regions through which the particles to move.

It is not restricted to simulating 1 region only (region having paralell E and or B fields).

This way I can decouple B+E field region from the only-E-field region next to it.
